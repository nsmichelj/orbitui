## Using the shadcn CLI with OrbitUI

To use OrbitUI components with the CLI, you must have shadcn/ui already initialized in your project. If you haven't done this yet, follow <a href="https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/installation" target="_blank">the official shadcn/ui installation guide</a>.

Once your project is ready, you can install components by pointing directly to their remote URL:

```bash
npx shadcn@latest add https://orbituidocs.vercel.app/shadcn/r/button.json
```

## Registry Configuration

To simplify the process and avoid typing full URLs every time, you can add OrbitUI as a custom registry in your `components.json` file:

```json
{
  "registries": {
    "@orbitui": "https://orbituidocs.vercel.app/shadcn/r/{name}.json"
  }
}
```

After adding the registry, you can install components using the shorthand syntax:

```bash
npx shadcn@latest add @orbitui/button
```
